Awesome job on your meticulous review, analysis and planning! Please keep up the good work in your rigorous and meticulous approach to planning and execution! Now, please think deeper and think harder to deeply and thoroughly explore systematically and meticulously how best to re-imagine a complete validated drop-in replacement file for each of the files, that incorporates your suggested fixes and improvements. Key consideration is to maintain compatibility with the project documents while fixing identified issues. First, review and validate the proposed updates (enhancements) against the original version again to ensure no regression after version upgrade, then meticulously create an comprehensive implementation plan to create a complete working replacement file for each of the files, include in your plan a checklist for each tool file that needs updating. Review and validate your implementation plan before proceeding meticulously to execute it. Remember to review and validate the newly generated replacement file to ensure that it is correct and accurate and that it does not contain any placeholder comment. Regression is a real threat whenever updates are made, so you need to be extremely thorough and meticulous in creating the complete updated replacement file for each of the tool files.
