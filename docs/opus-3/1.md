# Documents Received and Catalogued

I have thoroughly reviewed the uploaded documentation for the **PowerPoint Agent Tools** project. Here's my acknowledgment of what I've captured:

---

## 📚 Documents Received (Batch 1)

| Document | Content Summary | Key Sections Identified |
|----------|-----------------|------------------------|
| **README.md / Quick Start** | Project overview, installation, key concepts, v3.1.0 features | Quick Start, Key Concepts Table, What's New |
| **Architecture & Standards** | Complete technical specification | 11 major sections covering architecture, design philosophy, programming model, code standards, patterns, testing, contribution workflow |
| **AGENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT.md** | Comprehensive operational framework for AI agents | 10 parts covering governance, resilience, workflow phases, tool ecosystem, design intelligence, accessibility, templates, response protocol, constraints, QA |

## 🧠 Key Concepts I've Internalized

| Concept | Understanding |
|---------|---------------|
| **Hub-and-Spoke Architecture** | `powerpoint_agent_core.py` as the HUB; 39 CLI tools as SPOKES |
| **Stateless Operations** | Each call independent: Open → Modify → Save → Close |
| **Safety Hierarchy** | Clone → Probe → Operate → Refresh → Validate → Deliver |
| **Shape Index Volatility** | Must refresh indices after structural/z-order changes |
| **Opacity Model** | Modern `fill_opacity` (0.0-1.0) replaces deprecated `transparency` |
| **Manifest-Driven Workflow** | Every non-trivial task requires a Change Manifest |
| **Version Tracking** | `presentation_version` hash prevents race conditions |

## ✅ Status: Awaiting Additional Documents

I am **ready to receive the next batch of documents** in your following prompt.

Once you signal that all documents are uploaded, I will perform a **consolidated deep analysis** covering:

1. **WHAT** — Complete feature inventory and capabilities
2. **WHY** — Design rationale and architectural decisions
3. **HOW** — Implementation patterns, workflows, and integration points
