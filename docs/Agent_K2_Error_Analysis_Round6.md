# Agent K2 Error Analysis (Round 6)

## Error Description
During the final step of `agent_k2.sh`, the tool `ppt_export_images.py` failed with the error:
`PowerPointAgentError: Export completed but no image files found. Expected files in: /home/project/powerpoint-agent-tools/ppt_export`

## Root Cause Analysis
The tool successfully executed the LibreOffice export command (exit code 0), but failed to locate the generated image files in the output directory. This strongly suggests a **mismatch in expected file naming conventions**.

The tool expects LibreOffice to generate files with the pattern:
*   `filename.png` (if 1 slide)
*   `filename_01.png`, `filename_02.png`, etc. (if multiple slides)

It is possible that the installed version of LibreOffice uses a different naming scheme (e.g., `filename_1.png`, `filename1.png`, or `filename-1.png`).

## Investigation Plan
1.  Manually run the export command.
2.  Inspect the output directory to observe the actual filenames generated by LibreOffice.
3.  Adjust the file matching logic in `ppt_export_images.py` to accommodate the observed pattern.

## Proposed Fix
Update `ppt_export_images.py` to be more flexible in finding generated files, possibly by listing all files in the directory matching the pattern `filename*.<ext>` and sorting them, rather than predicting the exact name.
