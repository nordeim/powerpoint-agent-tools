Documentation Review
I have initialized the task and implementation plan, which have been approved by the user. I am now proceeding to read the documentation and analyze the codebase architecture.

Reading CLAUDE.md and AGENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT_enhanced.md to understand architecture

Synthesis & Confirmation
I have read the documentation and verified the file structure. I have confirmed the 'Hub-and-Spoke' architecture and the 'Meticulous Approach' requirements.

Summarizing architecture and confirming with user

Architectural Analysis & Confirmation
I have completed the review of CLAUDE.md, AGENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT_enhanced.md, and the codebase structure.

Architectural Summary
I confirm the Hub-and-Spoke architecture:

Core (core/powerpoint_agent_core.py): The stateless monolith handling XML manipulation and safety.
Tools (tools/): Atomic, JSON-speaking CLI wrappers.
Probe (tools/ppt_capability_probe.py): The "Deep Probe" strategy for layout discovery.
Operational Alignment
I have internalized the Meticulous Approach:

Deep Analysis: I will explore multiple paths before acting.
Systematic Planning: I will use task.md and implementation_plan.md for every significant task.
Technical Excellence: I will prioritize production-ready, tested code.
Transparent Communication: I will provide clear rationale and documentation.
I am ready to proceed with any coding tasks using this operating system.

# Implementation Plan - Project Onboarding & Architecture Analysis

## Goal Description
Thoroughly review `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT_enhanced.md` to understand the "PowerPoint Agent Tools" project architecture, specifically the "Hub-and-Spoke" model, statelessness, and deep probe strategy. This is a knowledge acquisition task to align with the "Meticulous Approach" operating system.

## User Review Required
None. This is an analysis phase.

## Proposed Changes
No code changes. This is a read-only analysis.

## Analysis Steps
1.  **Read Documentation**:
    *   `CLAUDE.md`: High-level project overview, commands, and architectural summary.
    *   `AGENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT_enhanced.md`: Detailed system prompt describing tool usage, safety, and agent behavior.
2.  **Codebase Exploration (Verification)**:
    *   List files in `/home/project/powerpoint-agent-tools` to visualize the tool structure.
    *   Check `powerpoint_agent_core.py` imports/structure if needed to confirm the "Core" role.
3.  **Synthesis**:
    *   Construct a mental model of the system.
    *   Report back to the user with a summary of the architecture to demonstrate understanding.

## Verification Plan
*   **Self-Correction**: Ensure the summary matches the "Verdict" and "Architectural Strengths" provided in the user's prompt snippet.
*   **User Confirmation**: Ask the user if the understanding aligns with their vision.
