I have completed the meticulous analysis of the ppt_capability_probe.py tool and its helpers. I verified the tool's output against the schema using a custom test script and identified two key findings: a missing jsonschema dependency and a minor version mismatch between the tool and the schema. The full analysis is available in capability_probe_analysis.md.
