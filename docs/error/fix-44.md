✅ Tool Development Guide Enhanced
I have meticulously merged the suggested improvements into PowerPoint_Tool_Development_Guide.md.

Key Enhancements:

Governance Principles: Added "Clone-Before-Edit", "Presentation Versioning", "Approval Tokens", and "Shape Index Management".
Master Template: Updated to include version tracking, governance checks, and standardized error handling.
API Cheatsheet: Updated with v3.1.0 features (opacity, notes) and governance warnings.
Error Handling: Added a standard exit code matrix (0-5) and response format.
Workflow Context: Mapped tools to the 5-phase workflow (DISCOVER-PLAN-CREATE-VALIDATE-DELIVER).
Testing & Contribution: Added comprehensive testing requirements and contribution checklists.
The guide is now a complete, self-sufficient reference for building v3.1.0 compliant tools.
