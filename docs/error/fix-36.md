Updating System Prompt with New Tools
I have read the documentation and the current system prompt. I have identified the sections where the new tools (
ppt_add_notes.py
, 
ppt_set_z_order.py
) and the enhanced tool (
ppt_replace_text.py
) should be integrated. I am now creating the 
Implementation Plan
.
