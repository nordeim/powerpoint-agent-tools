I have completed the System Prompt Alignment Check.

Findings:

Alignment: The AGENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT_enhanced.md is fully compatible with the current state of the powerpoint-agent-tools library. The recent code fixes (7-13) did not introduce any breaking changes for the agent's instructions.
Recommendations: I have identified four specific areas where the prompt can be enhanced to reinforce good practices and prevent future issues (e.g., "Inconsistent Fonts" or script logic errors).
Deliverable:

docs/System_Prompt_Alignment_Report_Final.md: Detailed report containing the validation results and the specific text for the recommended prompt additions.
The project is now fully verified, documented, and aligned.
