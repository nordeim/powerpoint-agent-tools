I have successfully refined ppt_capability_probe.py to version 1.1.0. Key enhancements include:

Robustness: Fixed JSON contract, enforced mutual exclusivity of flags, and added timeout/error handling.
Accuracy: Implemented dynamic placeholder type detection (covering all 20 enum types) and deep analysis mode for accurate positioning.
Features: Added multiple master support, theme extraction (with fallbacks), and comprehensive validation.
The tool passed all validation checks.
