Debugging Agent K2 Error (Round 5)
I have analyzed the entire log file. It appears that all operations were successful. There are no error entries in the log. The fixes implemented in Round 4 (default dimensions) successfully handled the missing size arguments on Slide 10 and others. I will now create a report confirming this success.
