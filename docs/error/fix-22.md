I have completed the review and implementation of the improvement suggestions from capability_probe_suggestions_for_improvement.md.

Actions Taken:

Validated Suggestions: Created validate_suggestions.py and confirmed the need for standardized layout references, symmetric recommendations, metadata audit fields, and essential mode placeholder maps.
Implemented Enhancements:
Standardized Layout References: Added original_index and master_index to all capability layout lists for full traceability.
Symmetric Recommendations: Added enumerations for slide number and date availability to mirror footer guidance.
Metadata Audit: Added layout_count_total and layout_count_analyzed to metadata for operational visibility.
Placeholder Map: Added a compact placeholder_map (type -> count) to layout info in essential mode to simplify downstream parsing.
Verified: Ran validate_suggestions.py to confirm all new features are present and correct.
Artifacts:
