Enhancing System Prompt
I have decided on the placement of the updates. I will add the deprecation note after the Visual Design table and insert the Python conceptual model into the Overlay Pattern section, while also updating the Bash script to be consistent.

Creating implementation plan for system prompt updates

I have prepared the implementation plan for the system prompt enhancements.

Plan:

Deprecation Note: Add the warning about transparency conversion after the Visual Design tool table.
Overlay Example: Update the "Safe Overlay Addition" pattern to include the Python conceptual model (as requested) and update the Bash script to use the new single-step opacity argument, removing the old workaround.
Please review implementation_plan.md.

✅ System Prompt Enhanced
I have meticulously updated AGENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT_enhanced.md with the requested improvements.

Changes Applied:

Deprecation Documentation: Added a clear note about transparency conversion to fill_opacity after the Visual Design tool table.
Complete Overlay Example:
Inserted the Python Conceptual Model to demonstrate the clean API usage.
Updated the CLI Execution script to use --fill-opacity 0.15 in a single step.
Removed the obsolete "workaround" step.
The system prompt now accurately reflects the new capabilities and provides clearer guidance for future agents.
