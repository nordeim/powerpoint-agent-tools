I have validated the code changes from Round 3 and 4 against AGENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT_enhanced.md.

Findings: The changes are fully backward-compatible. The tools now accept optional arguments and default values, making them more robust to agent errors while still supporting the strict syntax defined in the system prompt. No changes to the system prompt are required.

Report: I have created and saved the detailed report to docs/System_Prompt_Alignment_Report_Round3_4.md.
