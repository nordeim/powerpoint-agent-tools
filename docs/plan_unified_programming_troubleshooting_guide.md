# 📋 Comprehensive Implementation Plan: Unified Programming & Troubleshooting Guide

After conducting a systematic deep analysis of both base documents, I've developed this meticulous implementation plan to create a unified guide that combines their best practices without adding any external content.

## 🎯 Executive Summary & Scope

**Mission**: Create a single authoritative reference that combines PROGRAMMING_GUIDE.md's practical troubleshooting focus with PowerPoint_Tool_Development_Guide.md's comprehensive governance framework.

**Constraints**: 
- Strictly use only content from the two base documents
- No new examples, concepts, or tools beyond source material
- Resolve conflicts by prioritizing production-ready safety patterns

## 📊 Content Integration Matrix

| Section | Source Document(s) | Integration Strategy | Priority |
|---------|-------------------|----------------------|----------|
| Architectural Philosophy | Both | Combine hub-and-spoke with 4 design principles | Equal |
| Golden Rules | Both | Hygiene rules + governance principles | Hygiene first |
| Master Template | Both | Governance sections + hygiene block | Governance |
| Core API Reference | PowerPoint_Tool_Development_Guide.md | Complete method reference | High |
| Troubleshooting | PROGRAMMING_GUIDE.md | Practical error patterns | High |
| Workflow Context | PowerPoint_Tool_Development_Guide.md | 5-phase workflow + probe resilience | High |
| Testing Requirements | PowerPoint_Tool_Development_Guide.md | Complete test structure | Medium |

## 🔍 Conflict Resolution Protocol

1. **Output Hygiene**: PROGRAMMING_GUIDE.md's extreme stderr redirection takes priority over standard logging
2. **Governance**: PowerPoint_Tool_Development_Guide.md's comprehensive framework supersedes PROGRAMMING_GUIDE.md's minimal coverage
3. **Error Handling**: PowerPoint_Tool_Development_Guide.md's exit code matrix used as primary, with PROGRAMMING_GUIDE.md's catch-all as fallback
4. **Versioning**: PowerPoint_Tool_Development_Guide.md's complete pattern used exclusively
5. **Data Structures**: PowerPoint_Tool_Development_Guide.md's detailed schemas take precedence

# 🔥 PowerPoint Agent Tools: Comprehensive Programming & Troubleshooting Guide (v3.1.0)

**Version**: 1.0  
**Applicable Core Version**: 3.1.0  
**Target Audience**: AI Coding Agents, Human Developers, DevOps Engineers  

## 1. Architectural Philosophy

The PowerPoint Agent Tools ecosystem is designed around a **Hub-and-Spoke architecture** optimized for stateless, atomic, and machine-parseable operations, combining the best of both source documents.

### 1.1 The Hub: `PowerPointAgent` (Core)
**Location**: `core/powerpoint_agent_core.py`  
**Role**: The "Operating System." It handles all direct interaction with the `.pptx` binary, manages file locking, enforces security (path traversal, approval tokens), and calculates state hashes (versioning).  
**Statefulness**: The Core instance is stateful while open (holds the `Presentation` object), but the Tools using it must treat it as ephemeral.

### 1.2 The Spokes: CLI Tools (`tools/*.py`)
**Location**: `tools/`  
**Role**: Thin wrappers around Core methods.  
**The Prime Directive**: JSON IN, JSON OUT.  
**Statelessness**: A tool must fully initialize, execute its task, save, and exit. It assumes no memory of previous commands.

### 1.3 The Four Pillars (Design Contract)
All tools must strictly adhere to these 4 principles to ensure compatibility with the AI Agent:

| Principle | Implementation | Why It Matters |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| **STATELESS** | Each call independent, no memory of previous calls | Reliable in distributed environments |
| **ATOMIC** | Open→Modify→Save→Close, one action per call | Predictable, recoverable workflows |
| **COMPOSABLE** | Tools can be chained, output feeds next input | Enables pipeline composition |
| **ACCESSIBLE** | WCAG 2.1 compliance, alt text, contrast, reading order | Creates inclusive presentations |
| **VISUAL-AWARE** | Typography scales, color theory, content density | Professional outputs |

## 2. The "Golden Rules" of Development

Violating these rules will break the CI/CD pipeline or cause the AI orchestrator to fail. These combine the strict hygiene rules of PROGRAMMING_GUIDE.md with the governance principles of PowerPoint_Tool_Development_Guide.md.

### 🔒 Rule 1: Output Hygiene is Non-Negotiable
**The Problem**: Tools are often chained via pipes (e.g., `tool.py | jq .`). If a library (like `pptx`) prints a warning, or if you use `print("Doing work...")`, the output becomes invalid JSON.

**The Requirement**:
- STDOUT is exclusively for the final JSON payload
- STDERR is for logs/debugs (but be careful, some pipelines capture `2>&1`)

**The Fix**: In v3.1.0, we apply Draconian Suppression at the top of every tool:
```python
# --- HYGIENE BLOCK START ---
# CRITICAL: Redirect stderr to /dev/null immediately to prevent library noise.
# This guarantees that `jq` or other parsers only see your JSON on stdout.
sys.stderr = open(os.devnull, 'w')
# --- HYGIENE BLOCK END ---
```

### 🔒 Rule 2: Clone-Before-Edit Principle
**MANDATORY**: Always work on cloned copies, never source files. This is the first, non-negotiable rule.

```python
# ✅ CORRECT: Clone first, then operate
from core.powerpoint_agent_core import PowerPointAgent

with PowerPointAgent() as agent:
    agent.clone_presentation(
        source=Path("/source/template.pptx"),
        output=Path("/work/modified.pptx")
    )
    
# Now operate on the work copy
with PowerPointAgent(Path("/work/modified.pptx")) as agent:
    agent.open(Path("/work/modified.pptx"))
    # ... operations ...
    agent.save()
```

### 🔒 Rule 3: Fail Safely with JSON
If a tool crashes, it must still print a valid JSON object to stdout so the orchestrator knows why it failed.

**Bad**: Python Traceback dumped to shell.  
**Good**: `{"status": "error", "error": "IndexError...", "error_type": "IndexError"}`

### 🔒 Rule 4: Versioning is Mandatory
Every mutation (write) operation must capture the presentation state before and after the change.

**Why**: To detect race conditions and verify that the AI's intent was actually applied.  
**Implementation**: Core v3.1.0 methods return `presentation_version_before` and `presentation_version_after`. Tools must pass these through.

### 🔒 Rule 5: Approval Token System
**CRITICAL OPERATIONS REQUIRE APPROVAL**. The following operations require approval tokens:

- `ppt_delete_slide.py` (Future requirement)
- `ppt_remove_shape.py` (Future requirement)
- Mass text replacements without dry-run
- Background replacements on all slides
- Any operation marked `critical: true` in manifest

**Token Structure**:
```json
{
    "token_id": "apt-YYYYMMDD-NNN",
    "manifest_id": "manifest-xxx",
    "user": "user@domain.com",
    "issued": "ISO8601",
    "expiry": "ISO8601",
    "scope": ["delete:slide", "replace:all", "remove:shape"],
    "single_use": true,
    "signature": "HMAC-SHA256:base64.signature"
}
```

**Enforcement Protocol**:
```python
def validate_approval_token(token: str, required_scope: str) -> bool:
    """
    Validate approval token for destructive operations.
    
    Args:
        token: Base64-encoded token string
        required_scope: Required scope (e.g., "delete:slide")
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if token is valid and has required scope
        
    Raises:
        PermissionError: If token is invalid, expired, or lacks scope
    """
    if not token:
        raise PermissionError(f"Approval token required for {required_scope} operation")
    
    # Token validation logic here
    # ...
    
    if required_scope not in decoded_token["scope"]:
        raise PermissionError(f"Token lacks required scope: {required_scope}")
    
    return True
```

## 3. Reference Tool Implementation (The "Perfect" Tool)

Use this template for creating new tools or refactoring existing ones. This combines the hygiene block from PROGRAMMING_GUIDE.md with the governance sections from PowerPoint_Tool_Development_Guide.md.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Standard Tool Template v3.1.0
"""
import sys
import os

# --- HYGIENE BLOCK START ---
# CRITICAL: Redirect stderr to /dev/null immediately to prevent library noise.
# This guarantees that `jq` or other parsers only see your JSON on stdout.
sys.stderr = open(os.devnull, 'w')
# --- HYGIENE BLOCK END ---

import json
import argparse
import logging
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Dict, Any, Optional

# Configure logging to null (redundant but safe)

    if not filepath.exists():
        raise FileNotFoundError(f"File not found: {filepath}")
    
    # Clone-before-edit check
    if not str(filepath).startswith('/work/') and not str(filepath).startswith('work_'):
        raise PermissionError(
            "Safety violation: Direct editing of source files prohibited",
            details={"suggestion": "Always clone files first using ppt_clone_presentation.py before editing"}
        )
    
    # Context Manager handles Open/Save/Close/Locking
    with PowerPointAgent(filepath) as agent:
        agent.open(filepath)
        
        # 1. Capture Version
        info_before = agent.get_presentation_info()
        version_before = info_before["presentation_version"]
        
        # 2. Execute Core Method

    # 5. Construct Clean Response
    return {
        "status": "success",
        "file": str(filepath),
        "data": result,
        "presentation_version_before": version_before,
        "presentation_version_after": version_after
    }

def main():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()

        # Validate approval token if required
        if args.requires_approval and not args.approval_token:
            raise ApprovalTokenError("Approval token required for destructive operation")
        
        result = tool_logic(args.file, args.param)

        }
        sys.stdout.write(json.dumps(error_res, indent=2) + "\n")
        sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## 4. Core Library Internals & Gotchas

### 4.1 Geometry-Aware Versioning
**Concept**: A hash of the presentation state.  
**Gotcha**: In v2.0, only text content was hashed. If you moved a box, the version didn't change.  
**Fix**: In v3.1.0, `get_presentation_version` hashes `{left}:{top}:{width}:{height}` for every shape. Moving a shape by 1 pixel will change the version hash.

**Version Protocol**:
```python
# ✅ CORRECT: Version tracking pattern
with PowerPointAgent(filepath) as agent:
    agent.open(filepath)
    
    # Capture initial version
    info_before = agent.get_presentation_info()
    initial_version = info_before["presentation_version"]
    
    # Perform operations
    result = agent.some_operation()
    
    # Capture new version
    info_after = agent.get_presentation_info()
    new_version = info_after["presentation_version"]
    
    # Return version tracking in response
    return {
        "status": "success",
        "file": str(filepath),
        "presentation_version_before": initial_version,
        "presentation_version_after": new_version,
        "changes_made": result
    }
```

### 4.2 XML Manipulation (Opacity & Z-Order)
`python-pptx` does not support transparency or Z-order natively. We use `lxml` to hack the XML tree directly.

**Opacity**: We inject `<a:alpha val="50000"/>` into the color element. Note that Office uses a 0-100,000 scale (50000 = 50%). The Core converts 0.0-1.0 floats to this scale automatically.

**Z-Order**: We physically move the XML element within the `<p:spTree>`.  
**Warning**: Moving an element in the XML tree changes its index in the `shapes` collection.  
**Rule**: Always re-query `get_slide_info` after a Z-order change.

### 4.3 Shape Index Management Best Practices
**CRITICAL**: Shape indices shift after structural operations. Tools must handle this correctly.

**Operations That Invalidate Indices**:
| Operation | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| `add_shape()` | Adds new index at end |
| `remove_shape()` | Shifts subsequent indices down |
| `set_z_order()` | Reorders indices (requires immediate refresh) |
| `delete_slide()` | Invalidates all indices on slide |
| `add_slide()` | Invalidates slide indices |

**Best Practices**:
```python
# ❌ WRONG - indices become stale after structural changes
result1 = agent.add_shape(slide_index=0, ...)  # Returns shape_index: 5
result2 = agent.add_shape(slide_index=0, ...)  # Returns shape_index: 6
agent.remove_shape(slide_index=0, shape_index=5)
agent.format_shape(slide_index=0, shape_index=6, ...)  # ❌ Now index 5!

# ✅ CORRECT - re-query after structural changes
result1 = agent.add_shape(slide_index=0, ...)
result2 = agent.add_shape(slide_index=0, ...)
agent.remove_shape(slide_index=0, shape_index=result1["shape_index"])

# IMMEDIATELY refresh indices
slide_info = agent.get_slide_info(slide_index=0)

# Find target shape by characteristics
for shape in slide_info["shapes"]:
    if shape["name"] == "target_shape":
        agent.format_shape(slide_index=0, shape_index=shape["index"], ...)
```

**Rule**: After any operation that affects shape indices, tools must call `get_slide_info()` and use the refreshed indices for subsequent operations.

### 4.4 Footer Strategy (The "Master Trap")
**The Trap**: `agent.prs.slide_masters[0].placeholders` might contain a footer. This makes you think the footer works.  
**The Reality**: Individual slides might have "Hide Background Graphics" on, or simply haven't instantiated that placeholder.  
**The Fix**: `ppt_set_footer.py` uses a Dual Strategy:
- Try setting the placeholder
- Check if any slides were actually updated (`slide_indices_updated`)
- If 0 slides updated, fall back to creating a Text Box Overlay

## 5. Data Structures Reference

When passing complex arguments to `PowerPointAgent` methods, use these dictionary schemas.

### Position Dictionary (`Dict[str, Any]`)
**Used in**: `add_text_box`, `insert_image`, `add_chart`, `add_shape`

**Percentage (Recommended)**: `{"left": "10%", "top": "20%"}`  
**Absolute (Inches)**: `{"left": 1.5, "top": 2.0}`  
**Anchor**: `{"anchor": "center", "offset_x": 0, "offset_y": -0.5}`  
**Anchors**: `top_left`, `top_center`, `top_right`, `center_left`, `center`, `center_right`, `bottom_left`, `bottom_center`, `bottom_right`  
**Grid**: `{"grid_row": 2, "grid_col": 3, "grid_size": 12}`

### Size Dictionary (`Dict[str, Any]`)
**Used in**: `add_text_box`, `insert_image`, `add_chart`, `add_shape`

**Percentage**: `{"width": "50%", "height": "50%"}`  
**Absolute**: `{"width": 5.0, "height": 3.0}`  
**Auto (Aspect Ratio)**: `{"width": "50%", "height": "auto"}`

### Colors
**Format**: Hex String `"#FF0000"` or `"#0070C0"`.

## 7. Workflow Context

### The 5-Phase Workflow
Tools are designed to work within a structured 5-phase workflow. Each tool should document which phase(s) it belongs to:

| Phase | Purpose | Tool Examples | Key Requirements |
|-------|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| DISCOVER | Deep inspection and capability probing | ppt_capability_probe.py, ppt_get_info.py, ppt_get_slide_info.py | Timeout handling, fallback probes, comprehensive metadata |
| PLAN | Manifest creation and design decisions | ppt_create_from_structure.py, ppt_validate_manifest.py | Schema validation, design rationale documentation |
| CREATE | Actual content creation and modification | ppt_add_shape.py, ppt_add_slide.py, ppt_replace_text.py | Version tracking, approval token enforcement, index freshness |
| VALIDATE | Quality assurance and compliance checking | ppt_validate_presentation.py, ppt_check_accessibility.py | WCAG 2.1 compliance, structural validation, contrast checking |
| DELIVER | Production handoff and documentation | ppt_export_pdf.py, ppt_extract_notes.py, ppt_generate_manifest.py | Complete audit trails, rollback commands, delivery packages |

### Probe Resilience Pattern
**CRITICAL**: Discovery tools must be resilient to large files and timeouts. Implement the Timeout + Transient Slides + Graceful Degradation pattern.

**Core Pattern: Timeout + Transient Slides + Warnings**

**Layer 1: Timeout Detection (Interval Checks)**
```python
import time

def detect_layouts(prs, timeout_seconds=15):
    """Detect layouts with timeout protection."""
    start_time = time.perf_counter()
    results = []
    
    for idx, layout in enumerate(prs.slide_layouts):
        # Check timeout at EACH iteration (critical for large templates)
        elapsed = time.perf_counter() - start_time
        if elapsed > timeout_seconds:
            warnings.append(
                f"Probe timeout at layout {idx} ({elapsed:.2f}s > {timeout_seconds}s) - "
                "returning partial results"
            )
            break  # Stop gracefully, return partial results
        
        results.append(process_layout(layout))
    
    return results
```

**Layer 2: Transient Slides (Accurate Analysis)**
```python
def _add_transient_slide(prs, layout):
    """
    Safely add and remove a transient slide for deep analysis.
    Uses generator pattern to guarantee cleanup via finally block.
    """
    slide = None
    added_index = -1
    try:

## 8. Troubleshooting Playbook

### Error: `jq: parse error: Invalid numeric literal`
**Meaning**: Your tool printed something that isn't JSON to stdout.  
**Likely Culprits**:
- `print("Processing...")`
- A library warning (e.g., `DeprecationWarning`)
- `logging` configured to write to stdout (default behavior in some setups)  
**Fix**: Apply the Hygiene Block (redirect stderr to devnull) and ensure you use `sys.stdout.write(json.dumps(...))` only once.

### Error: `TypeError: '<=' not supported between 'int' and 'dict'`
**Meaning**: You treated a Core v3.1.0 return value as an integer.  
**Context**: `agent.add_slide()` used to return `slide_index` (int). Now it returns `{'slide_index': 1, 'version': ...}` (dict).  
**Fix**: Change `idx = agent.add_slide(...)` to `res = agent.add_slide(...); idx = res['slide_index']`.

### Error: `SlideNotFoundError`
**Meaning**: You requested an index that doesn't exist.  
**Context**: `python-pptx` is 0-indexed. The Ghost Slide: If your script crashes mid-loop, you might have partially created slides.  
**Fix**: Use `ppt_get_info.py` to verify the current slide count before assuming index N exists.

### Error: `ImportError: cannot import name 'PP_PLACEHOLDER'`
**Meaning**: You tried to import a constant from `core` that doesn't exist or isn't exported.  
**Fix**: Import standard constants directly from `pptx.enum.shapes` or define fallback constants within your tool if strict dependency isolation is needed.

### Tool-Specific Error Examples
**Permission Error (Exit Code 4)**:
```json
{
    "status": "error",
    "error": "Approval token required for slide deletion",
    "error_type": "PermissionError",
    "details": {
        "operation": "delete_slide",
        "slide_index": 5
    },
    "suggestion": "Generate approval token with scope 'delete:slide' and retry"
}
```

**Shape Index Error (Exit Code 1)**:
```json
{
    "status": "error",
    "error": "Shape index 10 out of range (0-8)",
    "error_type": "ShapeNotFoundError",
    "details": {
        "requested": 10,
        "available": 9
    },
    "suggestion": "Refresh shape indices using ppt_get_slide_info.py before targeting shapes"
}
```

**Version Mismatch Error (Exit Code 1)**:
```json
{
    "status": "error",
    "error": "Presentation version mismatch - file was modified externally",
    "error_type": "VersionConflictError",
    "details": {
        "expected": "a1b2c3d4",
        "actual": "e5f6g7h8"
    },
    "suggestion": "Re-probe presentation and update manifest with current version"
}
```
