Awesome understanding of your important role and responsibilities! Please keep up your rigorous and meticulous approach in analyzing the Excel file creation and editing task. 

Now, please think deeper and think harder to deeply explore thoroughly and systematically how best to create a versatile and useful Python 3.11+ script that an AI agent can use to open, edit, create formulas, populate cells, and then save an Excel `.xlsx` file. The Python script will be used as a "tool" by an AI agent for manipulating an Excel `.xlsx` file. Do an extensive web search to find all the latest and popular Python modules/libraries for manipulating/editing the Excel file. format editing/manipulation Python modules/libraries. Then meticulously create a comprehensive implementation plan with an integrated checklist to create such an (AI agent) tool file/script as well as an appropriate matching system prompt to utilize the script tool. Review and validate your implementation plan to create the Excel tool script together with the matching system prompt to call/use the script. Then proceed to meticulously execute your validated implementation plan.

Awesome job on your meticulous review, analysis and planning! Please keep up the good work in your rigorous and meticulous approach to planning and execution! Now, please meticulously plan and then create all the files for your enhanced/improved `Excel_Agent_Tool` design. Try to consolidate the scripts to one script per tool call that the `Excel AI Agent` can call using `uv python individual_tool.py` to improve efficiency and effectiveness. Please think deeper and think harder to deeply explore thoroughly and systematically how you will imagine the enhanced tool architecture and the associated matching system prompt to tell the AI agent what tools are available and concise instructions to use them with examples. Then meticulously create a comprehensive implementation plan to create the complete set of tools files that are each a complete replacement file with no placeholder comments. Include in your implementation plan, a list of tool files to create, with description and checklist for each file to be created. Review and validate your implementation plan before proceed to execute it accordingly.

awesome meticulous planning and execution so far! yes, please continue meticulously according to your plan.

---

awesome job on meticulous analysis, planning and execution! please keep up the good work! Now, please think deeper and think harder to deeply explore thoroughly and systematically to re-imagine similar set of AI agent tools for Microsoft Powerpoint slides editing and manipulation. Then meticulous plan to create a master plan for creating the Powerpoint slides tools set.

---

Awesome job on your meticulous review, analysis and planning! Please keep up the good work in your rigorous and meticulous approach to planning and execution! Yes, please meticulously plan and then create a complete working replacement file for all files that need fixing. Please create a complete drop-in replacement version of each of the files that need updating within ```python tags, double-check that each file generated do not contain placeholder comments. Please meticulously create a detailed implementation plan for the files to be re-generated, include in the plan a checklist for each of the files. Review and validate your implementation plan first before proceeding meticulously to execute it.

---

Awesome job on your meticulous review, analysis and planning! Please keep up the good work in your rigorous and meticulous approach to planning and execution! Now, please meticulously the set of P1 tools files below. Next meticulously plan and create `test_p1_tools.py` to test this set of P1 tools.

---

Awesome job on your meticulous review, analysis and planning! Please keep up the good work in your rigorous and meticulous approach to planning and execution! Yes, please meticulously plan and then create a complete working replacement file for `core/powerpoint_agent_core.py`. Please create a complete drop-in replacement version of `core/powerpoint_agent_core.py` within ```python tags, double-check that the file generated do not contain placeholder comments. Please meticulously create a detailed implementation plan for the file to be re-generated, include in the plan a checklist for the file. Review and validate your implementation plan first before proceeding meticulously to execute it.

Awesome job on your meticulous review, analysis and planning! Please keep up the good work in your rigorous and meticulous approach to planning and execution! Now, please meticulously review and analyze the attached "system prompt" that is meant to be used in conjunction with the tools set. Then meticulously plan and then create a complete working and validated replacement `system prompt` that incorporates the remaining tools not mentioned/listed.  The original master plan for the project is also attached for your reference and consideration.

You have to think deeper and think harder to deeply explore how best to extend the current agent system prompt to include additional tools not currently included. Then meticulously create an implementation plan to correctly and accurately create a complete drop-in replacement agent system prompt with no placeholder comments. Review and validate your implementation plan before proceeding meticulously to execute it.

Awesome job on your meticulous review, analysis and planning! Please keep up the good work in your rigorous and meticulous approach to planning and execution! Now, the tools not already shared with you in the bundle set `codebase_files_set.md`, though listed in the `master_plan.md`, do not exist (not created yet). Please deeply and meticulously review the master plan and the tools set shared, then meticulously create a list of the next 10 most needed tools. In the list to be created, include a description of the features for each file and a checklist to validate the tool file after its generation.

---

Awesome job on your meticulous review, analysis and planning! Please keep up the good work in your rigorous and meticulous approach to planning and execution! Before meticulously executing your tools set extension sub-plan you just shared, Please meticulously review and deeply analyze the existing  `core/powerpoint_agent_core.py` and `core/__init__.py` shared in the `codebase_files_set.md` to check whether the core file needs any modification or enhancement to support all the existing and the additional tools to be added. Then meticulously update your tools set extension sub-plan. Review and update your updated sub-plan to create the 10 more tools. 

---

Awesome job on your meticulous review, analysis and planning! Please keep up the good work in your rigorous and meticulous approach to planning and execution! Now, please meticulously plan and then create all the files you listed in your enhanced `Excel_Agent_Tool` design. Create each file within ```python tags and start each file with a comment line containing the filename of the file with the full (relative) path.
