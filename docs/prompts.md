Awesome job on your meticulous review, analysis and planning! Please keep up the good work in your rigorous and meticulous approach to planning and execution! Now, please meticulously review the attached "diff" output comparing the newly generated tool files against their original versions, double check to confirm that the newly generated files are correct and accurate and contain no regression issues.

Awesome job on your meticulous review, analysis and planning! Please keep up the good work in your rigorous and meticulous approach to planning and execution! Now, please meticulously review the attached slides generation script output logs (separate stdio & stderr) and the failing tool script (your last generated), then think deeper and think harder to deeply and thoroughly explore systematically and meticulously how best to fix the error. Key consideration is to maintain compatibility with the project documents while fixing identified issues. First, review and validate the proposed updates (enhancements) against the original files again to ensure no regression after version upgrade, then meticulously create an comprehensive implementation plan to create a complete working replacement file for each file that needs updating, include in your plan a checklist for each file that needs updating. Review and validate your implementation plan before proceeding meticulously to execute it. Remember to review and validate the newly generated replacement file to ensure that it is correct and accurate and that it does not contain any placeholder comment. Regression is a real threat whenever updates are made, so you need to be extremely thorough and meticulous in creating the complete updated replacement file.

It may be more productive for you to create an exhaustive test script to test all your assumptions and hypothesis and collect useful data for your analysis. Once you have nailed down the real root cause/culprit, then generate the complete replacement files for the failing tool files.

Awesome job on your meticulous review, analysis and planning! Please keep up the good work in your rigorous and meticulous approach to planning and execution! Now, please think deeper and think harder to deeply explore thoroughly and systematically how to re-imagine a comprehensive programming and troubleshooting guide   that correctly and accurately captures all your current deep understanding of the core file and tool file design and architecture. The comprehensive programming and troubleshooting guide will serve as a single source of truth for an AI coding agent or human developer to have the same deep understanding of the codebase design and architecture, including the quirks, pitfalls, gotchas, nuances, so that the AI coding agent or human developer will not repeat any of the coding errors and pitfalls. With this guide, the AI coding agent or human developer should be competent and confident enough to handle PRs and to create and modify a tool without error (hopefully). Create the guide as markdown document within ```markdown tags. Make sure you give enough examples and explanations to illustrate different scenarios and edge cases.

Think and explore thoroughly first, then meticulously create an comprehensive implementation plan to create the guide as a markdown file. Review and validate your implementation plan before proceeding meticulously to execute it.

Awesome job on your meticulous review, analysis and planning! Please keep up the good work in your rigorous and meticulous approach to planning and execution! Now, please meticulously review and analyze the two attached "development/programming guide" documents to critique and compare them. Check for any discrepancies between them.

---

Awesome job on your meticulous review, analysis and planning! Please keep up the good work in your rigorous and meticulous approach to planning and execution! Now, please think deeper and think harder to deeply explore thoroughly and systematically how to re-imagine a *unified* comprehensive programming and troubleshooting guide that combines the best practices from both base documents. Important to note: do NOT add anything not from the two base documents.


Think and explore thoroughly first, then meticulously create an comprehensive implementation plan to create the comprehensive "combined/unified" guide as a markdown file. Include an integrated checklist for the new guide. Review and validate your implementation plan before proceeding meticulously to execute it. After generating the complete validated "unified" guide document, meticulously review it again for correctness and accuracy, validate it against the checklist.

Awesome job on your meticulous review, analysis and planning! Please keep up the good work in your rigorous and meticulous approach to planning and execution! Now, please meticulously review and validate the attached programming guide `Comprehensive_Programming_and_Troubleshooting_Guide.md` which is the combination of your guide and the existing development guide.

Awesome job on your meticulous review, analysis and planning! Please keep up the good work in your rigorous and meticulous approach to planning and execution! Based on your last good generated version of `core/powerpoint_agent_core.py`, please please think deeper and think harder to deeply explore thoroughly and systematically how best to extract from it all the useful details and content like exports with detailed descriptions, to produce a comprehensive and accurate programming handbook for the core file that will help in developing and troubleshooting the downstream tool file. Meaning to create a programming model and description that accurately mirrors the actual `powerpoint_agent_core.py`, the same information that you will get from actually studying the actual code, information that will give very good insights into the features and capabilities available from the actual core file, information that is sufficient to troubleshoot any tool related issue, information that is a good distillation of the actual code for the core file.

Fully immersed in the core agent's inner workings. Focus on creating the most comprehensive guide possible. You will delve into the source code, meticulously documenting all exports, logic, dependencies, and architectural patterns. I'm focusing on capturing the nuances of the code, not just high-level overviews. This involves the classes: PowerPointAgent, FileLock, PathValidator, and so on. My aim is to make this the source of truth for developers.

Create the progamming handbook for  `powerpoint_agent_core.py`  as a markdown document within ```markdown tags. Think and explore thoroughly first, then meticulously create an comprehensive implementation plan to create the programming handbook as a markdown file. Review and validate your implementation plan before proceeding meticulously to execute it.
