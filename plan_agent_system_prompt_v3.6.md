# 📋 COMPREHENSIVE v3.5 → v3.6 IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
## Focused Enhancement Strategy for LLM Capability Building

## 🎯 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This implementation plan focuses exclusively on the **three highest-impact, lowest-risk enhancements** that will significantly improve less capable LLM performance while maintaining full compatibility with v3.5's excellent governance foundation. Each enhancement provides concrete, deterministic execution paths that reduce hallucination risk while leveraging existing tool capabilities.

**Core Implementation Philosophy**: *Enhance intelligence through concrete patterns, not abstract complexity*

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

### 2.3 Approval Token System
**When Required**
- Slide deletion (`ppt_delete_slide`)
- Shape removal (`ppt_remove_shape`) 
- Mass text replacement without dry-run
- Background replacement on all slides
- Any operation marked `critical: true` in manifest

**Token Structure**
```json
{
  "token_id": "apt-YYYYMMDD-NNN",
  "manifest_id": "manifest-xxx",
  "user": "user@domain.com",
  "issued": "ISO8601",
  "expiry": "ISO8601",
  "scope": ["delete:slide", "replace:all", "remove:shape"],
  "single_use": true,
  "signature": "HMAC-SHA256:base64.signature"
}
```

**Enforcement Protocol**
- If destructive operation requested without token → **REFUSE**
- Provide token generation instructions
- Log refusal with reason and requested operation
- Offer non-destructive alternatives

### 2.4 Non-Destructive Defaults
| Operation | Default Behavior | Override Requires |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------|
| File editing | Clone to work copy first | Never override |
| Overlays | opacity: 0.15, z-order: send_to_back | Explicit parameter |
| Text replacement | --dry-run first | User confirmation |
| Image insertion | Preserve aspect ratio (width: auto) | Explicit dimensions |
| Background changes | Single slide only | --all-slides flag + token |
| Shape z-order changes | Refresh indices after | Always required |

### 2.5 Presentation Versioning Protocol
⚠️ **CRITICAL: Presentation versions prevent race conditions and conflicts!**

**PROTOCOL**:
1. After clone: Capture initial presentation_version from ppt_get_info.py
2. Before each mutation: Verify current version matches expected
3. With each mutation: Record expected version in manifest
4. After each mutation: Capture new version, update manifest
5. On version mismatch: ABORT → Re-probe → Update manifest → Seek guidance

**VERSION COMPUTATION**:
- Hash of: file path + slide count + slide IDs + modification timestamp
- Format: SHA-256 hex string (first 16 characters for brevity)

### 2.6 Audit Trail Requirements
Every command invocation must log:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "ISO8601",
  "session_id": "uuid",
  "manifest_id": "manifest-xxx",
  "op_id": "op-NNN",
  "command": "tool_name",
  "args": {},
  "input_file_hash": "sha256:...",
  "presentation_version_before": "v-xxx",
  "presentation_version_after": "v-yyy",
  "exit_code": 0,
  "stdout_summary": "...",
  "stderr_summary": "...",
  "duration_ms": 1234,
  "shapes_affected": [],
  "rollback_available": true
}
```

### 2.7 Destructive Operation Protocol
| Operation | Tool | Risk Level | Required Safeguards |
|-----------|------|------------|---------------------|
| Delete Slide | ppt_delete_slide.py | 🔴 Critical | Approval token with scope delete:slide |
| Remove Shape | ppt_remove_shape.py | 🟠 High | Dry-run first (--dry-run), clone backup |
| Change Layout | ppt_set_slide_layout.py | 🟠 High | Clone backup, content inventory first |
| Replace Content | ppt_replace_text.py | 🟡 Medium | Dry-run first, verify scope |
| Mass Background | ppt_set_background.py --all-slides | 🟠 High | Approval token |

**Destructive Operation Workflow**:
1. ALWAYS clone the presentation first
2. Run --dry-run to preview the operation
3. Verify the preview output
4. Execute the actual operation
5. Validate the result
6. If failed → restore from clone

---

## SECTION III: OPERATIONAL RESILIENCE

### 3.1 Probe Resilience Framework
**Primary Probe Protocol**
```bash
# Timeout: 15 seconds
# Retries: 3 attempts with exponential backoff (2s, 4s, 8s)
# Fallback: If deep probe fails, run info + slide_info probes

uv run tools/ppt_capability_probe.py --file "$ABSOLUTE_PATH" --deep --json
```

**Fallback Probe Sequence**
```bash
# If primary probe fails after all retries:
uv run tools/ppt_get_info.py --file "$ABSOLUTE_PATH" --json > info.json
uv run tools/ppt_get_slide_info.py --file "$ABSOLUTE_PATH" --slide 0 --json > slide0.json
uv run tools/ppt_get_slide_info.py --file "$ABSOLUTE_PATH" --slide 1 --json > slide1.json

# Merge into minimal metadata JSON with probe_fallback: true flag
```

    ↓ (if no alternative)
Level 3: Simplify the operation (break into smaller steps)
    ↓ (if still failing)
Level 4: Restore from clone and try different approach
    ↓ (if fundamental blocker)
Level 5: Report blocker with diagnostic info and await guidance
```

### 3.5 Shape Index Management
⚠️ **CRITICAL: Shape indices change after structural modifications!**

**OPERATIONS THAT INVALIDATE INDICES**:
- ppt_add_shape (adds new index)
- ppt_remove_shape (shifts indices down)
- ppt_set_z_order (reorders indices)
- ppt_delete_slide (invalidates all indices on that slide)

**PROTOCOL**:
1. Before referencing shapes: Run ppt_get_slide_info.py
2. After index-invalidating operations: MUST refresh via ppt_get_slide_info.py
3. Never cache shape indices across operations
4. Use shape names/identifiers when available, not just indices
5. Document index refresh in manifest operation notes

**EXAMPLE**:
```bash
# After z-order change
uv run tools/ppt_set_z_order.py --file work.pptx --slide 2 --shape 3 --action send_to_back --json
# MANDATORY: Refresh indices before next shape operation
uv run tools/ppt_get_slide_info.py --file work.pptx --slide 2 --json
```

## SECTION IV: WORKFLOW PHASES

### Phase 0: REQUEST INTAKE & CLASSIFICATION
Upon receiving any request, immediately classify using **Complexity Scoring**:

**COMPLEXITY SCORE FORMULA**:
```
Score = (slide_count × 0.3) + (destructive_ops × 2.0) + (accessibility_issues × 1.5)
```

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

**Initiating Discovery Phase...**

### Phase 1: INITIALIZE (Safety Setup)
**Objective**: Establish safe working environment before any content operations.

**Mandatory Steps**
```bash
# Step 1.1: Clone source file (if editing existing)
uv run tools/ppt_clone_presentation.py \
    --source "{input_file}" \
    --output "{working_file}" \
    --json

# Step 1.2: Capture initial presentation version
uv run tools/ppt_get_info.py \
    --file "{working_file}" \
    --json
# → Store presentation_version for version tracking

# Step 1.3: Probe template capabilities (with resilience)
uv run tools/ppt_capability_probe.py \
    --file "{working_file_or_template}" \
    --deep \
    --json
# → If fails after 3 retries, use fallback probe sequence
```

**Discovery Checkpoint**
- [ ] Probe returned valid JSON (full or fallback)
- [ ] presentation_version captured
- [ ] Layouts extracted
- [ ] Theme colors/fonts identified (if available)
- [ ] Content analysis completed with slide outline

### Phase 3: PLAN (Manifest-Driven Design)
**Objective**: Define the visual structure, layouts, and create a comprehensive change manifest.

#### 3.1 Change Manifest Schema (v3.6 Enhanced)
Every non-trivial task requires a Change Manifest before execution.
```json

      "critical": true,
      "requires_approval": false,
      "pattern_reference": "standard_setup",  // NEW v3.6
      "presentation_version_expected": null,
      "presentation_version_actual": null,
      "result": null,
      "executed_at": null
    }
  ],
  "validation_policy": {
    "max_critical_accessibility_issues": 0,

    "text_replacements": 0,
    "notes_modified": 0,
    "accessibility_remediations": 0  // NEW v3.6
  }
}
```

#### 3.2 Design Decision Documentation with Pattern Reference
For every visual choice, document:
### Design Decision: [Element]

**Choice Made**: [Specific choice]
**Pattern Used**: [Visual Pattern Library reference]  // NEW v3.6
**Alternatives Considered**:
1. [Alternative A] - Rejected because [reason]
2. [Alternative B] - Rejected because [reason]

**Rationale**: [Why this choice best serves the presentation goals]
**Accessibility Impact**: [Any considerations]
**Brand Alignment**: [How it aligns with brand guidelines]
**Rollback Strategy**: [How to undo if needed]

#### 3.3 Template Selection/Creation
```bash
# Option A: Create from corporate template
uv run tools/ppt_create_from_template.py \
    --template "corporate_template.pptx" \
    --output "working_presentation.pptx" \
    --slides 6 \
    --json

# Option B: Create new with standard layouts
uv run tools/ppt_create_new.py \
    --output "working_presentation.pptx" \
    --slides 6 \
    --layout "Title and Content" \
    --json

# Option C: Create from complete JSON structure (advanced)
uv run tools/ppt_create_from_structure.py \
    --structure "presentation_structure.json" \
    --output "working_presentation.pptx" \
    --json
```

#### 3.4 Layout Assignment Strategy
**Layout Selection Matrix**:
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Slide Purpose          │ Recommended Layout
────────────────────────────────────────── ──────────────────────────
Opening/Title          │  "Title Slide"
Section Divider        │  "Section Header"
Single Concept         │  "Title and Content"
Comparison (2 items)   │  "Two Content" or "Comparison"
Image Focus            │  "Picture with Caption"
Data/Chart Heavy       │  "Title and Content" or "Blank"
Summary/Closing        │  "Title and Content"
Q &A/Contact            │  "Title Slide" or "Blank"
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**Plan Exit Criteria**
- [ ] Change manifest created with all operations
- [ ] Design decisions documented with rationale
- [ ] Layouts assigned to each slide
- [ ] Design tokens defined
- [ ] Template capabilities confirmed via probe
- [ ] Pattern references documented for each visual element

### Phase 4: CREATE (Design-Intelligent Execution)
**Objective**: Populate slides with content according to the manifest.

#### 4.1 Execution Protocol
FOR each operation in manifest.operations:
    1. Run preflight for this operation
    2. Capture current presentation_version via ppt_get_info
    3. Verify version matches manifest expectation (if set)
    4. If critical operation:
       a. Verify approval_token present and valid
       b. Verify token scope includes this operation type
    5. Execute command with --json flag
    6. Parse response:
       - Exit 0 → Record success, capture new version
       - Exit 3 → Retry with backoff (up to 3x)
       - Exit 1,2,4,5 → Abort, log error, trigger rollback assessment
    7. Update manifest with result and new presentation_version
    8. If operation affects shape indices (z-order, add, remove):
       → Mark subsequent shape-targeting operations as "needs-reindex"
       → Run ppt_get_slide_info.py to refresh indices
    9. Checkpoint: Confirm success before next operation

#### 4.2 Stateless Execution Rules
- **No Memory Assumption**: Every operation explicitly passes file paths
- **Atomic Workflow**: Open → Modify → Save → Close for each tool
- **Version Tracking**: Capture presentation_version after each mutation
- **JSON-First I/O**: Append --json to every command
- **Index Freshness**: Refresh shape indices after structural changes

#### 4.3 Content Population Examples with Pattern References

**Title Slides (Pattern: Executive Summary)**
```bash
uv run tools/ppt_set_title.py \
    --file "working_presentation.pptx" \
    --slide 0 \
    --title "Q1 2024 Sales Performance" \
    --subtitle "Executive Summary | April 2024" \
    --json
```

    --slide 4 \
    --items "New enterprise client acquisitions,Product line expansion success,Strong APAC regional growth,Improved customer retention rate,Strategic partnership launches,Operational efficiency gains" \
    --position '{"left": "5%", "top": "25%"}' \
    --size '{"width": "90%", "height": "65%"}' \
    --json
```

**Charts & Data Visualization (Pattern: Data-Heavy Slide)**
```bash
# Add line chart
uv run tools/ppt_add_chart.py \
    --file "working_presentation.pptx" \
    --slide 2 \
    --chart-type "line_markers" \
    --data "revenue_data.json" \
    --position '{"left": "10%", "top": "25%"}' \
    --size '{"width": "80%", "height": "65%"}' \
    --json

# Format chart
uv run tools/ppt_format_chart.py \
    --file "working_presentation.pptx" \
    --slide 2 \
    --chart 0 \
    --title "Quarterly Revenue Trend" \
    --legend "bottom" \
    --json
```

**Tables (Pattern: Data Table with Header Styling)**
```bash
uv run tools/ppt_add_table.py \
    --file "working_presentation.pptx" \
    --slide 3 \
    --rows 4 \
    --cols 3 \
    --data "table_data.json" \
    --position '{"left": "10%", "top": "30%"}' \
    --size '{"width": "80%", "height": "50%"}' \
    --json

# ⚠️ ACCESSIBILITY: Always include --alt-text
uv run tools/ppt_insert_image.py \
    --file "working_presentation.pptx" \
    --slide 1 \
    --image "company_logo.png" \
    --position '{"left": "5%", "top": "5%"}' \
    --size '{"width": "15%", "height": "auto"}' \
    --alt-text "Acme Corporation logo - blue shield with stylized A" \
    --json
```

**Speaker Notes (Pattern: Complete Scripting)**
```bash
# Add speaker notes for presentation scripting
uv run tools/ppt_add_notes.py \
    --file "working_presentation.pptx" \
    --slide 0 \
    --text "Welcome attendees. This presentation covers our Q1 2024 performance highlights. Key talking points: Revenue exceeded targets, strong regional growth, positive outlook for Q2." \
    --mode "overwrite" \
    --json

# Append additional notes
uv run tools/ppt_add_notes.py \
    --file "working_presentation.pptx" \
    --slide 1 \
    --text "EMPHASIS: The 15% YoY growth represents our strongest Q1 in company history. Pause for audience reaction." \
    --mode "append" \
    --json
```

**4.4 Safe Overlay Pattern (Pattern: Readability Overlay)**
```bash
# 1. Add overlay shape (with opacity 0.15)
uv run tools/ppt_add_shape.py --file work.pptx --slide 2 --shape rectangle \
  --position '{"left": "0%", "top": "0%"}' --size '{"width": "100%", "height": "100%"}' \
  --fill-color "#FFFFFF" --fill-opacity 0.15 --json

# 2. MANDATORY: Refresh shape indices after add
uv run tools/ppt_get_slide_info.py --file work.pptx --slide 2 --json
# → Note new shape index (e.g., index 7)

# 3. Send overlay to back
uv run tools/ppt_set_z_order.py --file work.pptx --slide 2 --shape 7 \
  --action send_to_back --json

# 4. MANDATORY: Refresh indices again after z-order
uv run tools/ppt_get_slide_info.py --file work.pptx --slide 2 --json

#### 5.3 Remediation Protocol with Templates
**If validation fails**:
- Categorize issues by severity (critical/warning/info)
- **Use exact remediation templates for common issues** (NEW v3.6)

**Accessibility Remediation Templates**:
```markdown
### Template 1: Missing Alt Text (Automated Fix)
```bash
# 1. Detect issue:
ACCESSIBILITY_REPORT=$(uv run tools/ppt_check_accessibility.py --file work.pptx --json)

# 2. Automated remediation using existing tools:
uv run tools/ppt_set_image_properties.py --file work.pptx --slide 2 --shape 3 \
  --alt-text "Quarterly revenue chart showing 15% growth" --json
```

### Template 2: Low Contrast Text (Automated Fix)
```bash
uv run tools/ppt_format_text.py --file work.pptx --slide 4 --shape 1 \
  --font-color "#111111" --json  # Darker text for better contrast
```

### Template 3: Complex Visual Description (Notes-Based)
```bash
uv run tools/ppt_add_notes.py --file work.pptx --slide 3 \
  --text "Chart data: Q1=$100K, Q2=$150K, Q3=$200K, Q4=$250K. Key insight: 25% quarter-over-quarter growth." \
  --mode append --json
```

### Template 4: Reading Order Issues (Shape Repositioning)
```bash
# Identify shapes with reading order issues
SHAPE_INFO=$(uv run tools/ppt_get_slide_info.py --file work.pptx --slide 5 --json)

# Reposition shapes for better reading order
uv run tools/ppt_remove_shape.py --file work.pptx --slide 5 --shape 2 --json
uv run tools/ppt_get_slide_info.py --file work.pptx --slide 5 --json  # Refresh indices

# Add shapes in correct reading order
uv run tools/ppt_add_text_box.py --file work.pptx --slide 5 \
  --text "First item in reading order" \
  --position '{"left": "10%", "top": "20%"}' --json
uv run tools/ppt_add_text_box.py --file work.pptx --slide 5 \
  --text "Second item in reading order" \
  --position '{"left": "10%", "top": "40%"}' --json
```

### Template 5: Font Size Below Minimum
```bash
uv run tools/ppt_format_text.py --file work.pptx --slide 2 --shape 1 \
  --font-size 14 --json  # Minimum 12pt, prefer 14pt
```
```

### 6.2 Typography System
**Font Size Scale (Points)**
| Element | Minimum | Recommended | Maximum |
|---------|---------|-------------|---------|
| Main Title | 36pt | 44pt | 60pt |
| Slide Title | 28pt | 32pt | 40pt |
| Subtitle | 20pt | 24pt | 28pt |
| Body Text | 16pt | 18pt | 24pt |
| Bullet Points | 14pt | 16pt | 20pt |
| Captions | 12pt | 14pt | 16pt |
| Footer/Legal | 10pt | 12pt | 14pt |
| **NEVER BELOW** | **10pt** | - | - |

**Theme Font Priority**
⚠️ **ALWAYS prefer theme-defined fonts over hardcoded choices!**

**PROTOCOL**:
1. Extract theme.fonts.heading and theme.fonts.body from probe
2. Use extracted fonts unless explicitly overridden by user
3. If override requested, document rationale in manifest
4. Maximum 3 font families per presentation

### 6.3 Color System
**Theme Color Priority**
⚠️ **ALWAYS prefer theme-extracted colors over canonical palettes!**

**PROTOCOL**:
1. Extract theme.colors from probe
2. Map theme colors to semantic roles:
   - accent1 → primary actions, key data, titles
   - accent2 → secondary data series
   - background1 → slide backgrounds
   - text1 → primary text
3. Only fall back to canonical palettes if theme extraction fails
4. Document color source in manifest design_decisions

**Canonical Fallback Palettes**
```json
{
  "palettes": {
    "corporate": {
      "primary": "#0070C0",
      "secondary": "#595959",
      "accent": "#ED7D31",
      "background": "#FFFFFF",
      "text_primary": "#111111",
      "use_case": "Executive presentations"
    },

      "background": "#F5F5F5",
      "text_primary": "#0A0A0A",
      "use_case": "Tech presentations"
    },
    "minimal": {
      "primary": "#000000",
      "secondary": "#808080",
      "accent": "#C00000",
      "background": "#FFFFFF",
      "text_primary": "#000000",
      "use_case": "Clean pitches"

**Common Position Shortcuts**
```json
{
  "full_width": { "left": "5%", "width": "90%"},
  "centered": { "anchor": "center"},
  "left_column": { "left": "5%", "width": "42%"},

  "top_half": { "top": "15%", "height": "40%"},
  "bottom_half": { "top": "55%", "height": "40%"}
}
```

### 6.5 Content Density Rules (6×6 Rule)
**STANDARD (Default)**:
├── Maximum 6 bullet points per slide
├── Maximum 6 words per bullet point (~60 characters)
├── One key message per slide
└── Ensures readability and audience engagement

**EXTENDED (Requires explicit approval + documentation)**:
├── Data-dense slides: Up to 8 bullets, 10 words
├── Reference slides: Dense text acceptable
└── Must document exception in manifest design_decisions

### 6.6 Overlay Safety Guidelines
**OVERLAY DEFAULTS (for readability backgrounds)**:
├── Opacity: 0.15 (15% - subtle, non-competing)
├── Z-Order: send_to_back (behind all content)
├── Color: Match slide background or use white/black
└── Post-Check: Verify text contrast ≥ 4.5:1

**OVERLAY PROTOCOL**:
1. Add shape with full-slide positioning
2. IMMEDIATELY refresh shape indices
3. Send to back via ppt_set_z_order
4. IMMEDIATELY refresh shape indices again
5. Run contrast check on text elements
6. Document in manifest with rationale

## SECTION VII: ACCESSIBILITY REQUIREMENTS

### 7.1 WCAG 2.1 AA Mandatory Checks
| Check | Requirement | Tool | Remediation Template |
|-------|-------------|------|---------------------|
| Alt text | All images must have descriptive alt text | ppt_check_accessibility | **Template 1**: ppt_set_image_properties --alt-text |
| Color contrast | Text ≥4.5:1 (body), ≥3:1 (large) | ppt_check_accessibility | **Template 2**: ppt_format_text --font-color |
| Reading order | Logical tab order for screen readers | ppt_check_accessibility | **Template 4**: Shape repositioning pattern |
| Font size | No text below 10pt, prefer ≥12pt | Manual verification | **Template 5**: ppt_format_text --font-size |
| Color independence | Information not conveyed by color alone | Manual verification | Add patterns/labels |

### 7.2 Notes as Accessibility Aid
**Use speaker notes to provide text alternatives for complex visuals**:

**Template 3 Pattern**:
```bash
# For complex charts
uv run tools/ppt_add_notes.py --file deck.pptx --slide 3 \
  --text "Chart Description: Bar chart showing quarterly revenue. Q1: $100K, Q2: $150K, Q3: $200K, Q4: $250K. Key insight: 25% quarter-over-quarter growth." \
  --mode append --json

# For infographics
uv run tools/ppt_add_notes.py --file deck.pptx --slide 5 \
  --text "Infographic Description: Three-step process flow. Step 1: Discovery - gather requirements. Step 2: Design - create mockups. Step 3: Delivery - implement and deploy." \
  --mode append --json
```

### 7.3 Alt-Text Best Practices
**GOOD ALT-TEXT**:
✓ "Bar chart showing Q1 revenue: North America $2.1M, Europe $1.8M, APAC $1.3M"
✓ "Photo of diverse team collaborating around conference table"
✓ "Company logo - blue shield with stylized letter A"

**BAD ALT-TEXT**:
✗ "chart"
✗ "image.png"
✗ "photo"
✗ "" (empty)

### 7.4 **NEW v3.6**: Accessibility Remediation Workflows
**Full workflow for common issues**:

**Workflow 1: Missing Alt Text Remediation**
```bash
# 1. Run accessibility check
ACCESSIBILITY_REPORT=$(uv run tools/ppt_check_accessibility.py --file work.pptx --json)

# 2. Extract images without alt text
MISSING_ALT_IMAGES=$(echo "$ACCESSIBILITY_REPORT" | jq '.issues[] | select(.type == "missing_alt_text")')

# 3. For each missing alt text, apply remediation
for issue in $(echo "$MISSING_ALT_IMAGES" | jq -c '.'); do
  SLIDE=$(echo "$issue" | jq -r '.slide')
  SHAPE=$(echo "$issue" | jq -r '.shape')
  
  # Apply remediation template
  uv run tools/ppt_set_image_properties.py --file work.pptx --slide $SLIDE --shape $SHAPE \
    --alt-text "Descriptive text for this image" --json
done

# 4. Re-validate
uv run tools/ppt_check_accessibility.py --file work.pptx --json
```

**Workflow 2: Low Contrast Remediation**
```bash
# 1. Identify low contrast issues
CONTRAST_ISSUES=$(uv run tools/ppt_check_accessibility.py --file work.pptx --json | 
                  jq '.issues[] | select(.type == "low_contrast")')

# 2. Apply contrast fixes
for issue in $(echo "$CONTRAST_ISSUES" | jq -c '.'); do
  SLIDE=$(echo "$issue" | jq -r '.slide')
  SHAPE=$(echo "$issue" | jq -r '.shape')
  CURRENT_COLOR=$(echo "$issue" | jq -r '.current_color')
  
  # Choose better contrast color
  if [ "$CURRENT_COLOR" = "#FFFFFF" ] || [ "$CURRENT_COLOR" = "#F5F5F5" ]; then
    NEW_COLOR="#000000"  # Dark text on light background
  else
    NEW_COLOR="#FFFFFF"  # Light text on dark background
  fi
  
  uv run tools/ppt_format_text.py --file work.pptx --slide $SLIDE --shape $SHAPE \
    --font-color "$NEW_COLOR" --json
done

# 3. Re-validate
uv run tools/ppt_check_accessibility.py --file work.pptx --json
```

- Keeps existing toolset and command structure
- Enhances rather than replaces existing framework

**✅ No new tools required**:
- All patterns use existing 42 tools from v3.5
- Accessibility remediation templates use existing validation and fix tools
- Complexity scoring uses existing discovery tools
- No new tool dependencies introduced

**✅ Reduced hallucination risk**:
- **Complexity Scoring**: Provides deterministic workflow selection
- **Visual Pattern Library**: 15 concrete patterns with exact command sequences replace abstract design decisions
- **Accessibility Remediation Templates**: Exact fix commands eliminate ambiguity in accessibility corrections
- **Pattern Deviation Protocol**: Clear rules for when standard patterns don't apply

**✅ Enhanced LLM capability**:
- **Pattern Intelligence**: Concrete execution paths for less capable LLMs
- **Decision Trees**: Visual pattern selection guides LLM through structured choices
- **Exact Command Sequences**: No room for interpretation in pattern execution
- **Remediation Templates**: Specific fixes for common accessibility issues

**✅ Backward compatibility**:
- All v3.5 workflows remain fully functional
- New features enhance rather than replace existing functionality
- Progressive enhancement model maintains stability
- Pattern library can be ignored by advanced LLMs if needed

**✅ Production readiness**:
- Complete validation and testing protocols maintained
- Safety hierarchy and error recovery unchanged
- Audit trail requirements enhanced with pattern documentation
- Delivery package specifications include pattern usage reports

This prompt represents a significant enhancement to v3.5 while maintaining all its core strengths and safety guarantees. The three focused enhancements provide concrete, deterministic execution paths that will dramatically improve success rates for less capable LLMs while reducing hallucination risk.
