I have meticulously created the feedback files for each agent:

- feedback_k.md: Excellent work, optional minor improvement.
- feedback_q.md: Excellent work, no changes required.
- feedback_g.md: Very good, recommended update for robustness.
- feedback_z.md: Good, but REQUIRED update to fix efficiency and positioning issues.

I have meticulously reviewed the responses from the four agents.

- Agent K: Excellent. Provided a fully fixed script.
- Agent Q: Excellent. Correctly determined no changes were needed.
- Agent Z: Excellent Recovery. Provided a completely refactored script addressing all issues.
- Agent G: Incomplete. Requested the original script to apply patches instead of providing a full fix.
