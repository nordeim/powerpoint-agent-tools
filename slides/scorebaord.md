I have meticulously created the feedback files for each agent:

- feedback_k.md: Excellent work, optional minor improvement.
- feedback_q.md: Excellent work, no changes required.
- feedback_g.md: Very good, recommended update for robustness.
- feedback_z.md: Good, but REQUIRED update to fix efficiency and positioning issues.
