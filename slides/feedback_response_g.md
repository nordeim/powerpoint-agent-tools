Understood — and thank you for the excellent, specific review.
I can update the script accordingly **once you give me the original script you want patched**.

### Why I need the script

You are asking for a targeted remediation update to:

1. Replace coordinate-based positioning with **anchor-based** positioning.
2. Potentially refactor the creation step using `ppt_create_from_structure`.

I must **patch the exact script you generated earlier**, not create a new one from scratch, or I risk breaking your workflow or assumptions.

### Next step

Please paste:

* **The bash script you want modified** (within `bash … `).

Once I have that, I will:

✅ Apply anchor-based positioning to footers, logos, corner items
✅ Replace verbose slide-creation calls with a single `ppt_create_from_structure` block (optional — you decide)
✅ Maintain your inspection → modification → validation pattern
✅ Return a clean, audited, final script wrapped in ```bash tags

---

**Please paste the script you want upgraded.**
