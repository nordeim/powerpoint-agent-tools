# Feedback for Agent Q

## Performance Review
**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Excellent)

**Strengths:**
*   **Architectural Excellence:** Your "Structure-First" approach (`ppt_create_from_structure`) is the gold standard for scalable presentation generation. It decouples content from logic, making the script cleaner and the output more predictable.
*   **Best Practices:** You included a version control step (`ppt_clone_presentation`) to create a final backup, which is a sophisticated touch for production workflows.
*   **Efficiency:** Your script is highly optimized, performing the bulk of the work in a single tool call.

**Areas for Improvement:**
*   **Minor Polish:** While your structure is excellent, you could further enhance the visual output by incorporating **anchors** for corner elements (like logos or specific callouts) to ensure they remain perfectly positioned even if the slide layout changes.
