The recent downturn in Bitcoin price has been driven by a combination of macroeconomic pressures, market structure imbalances, and shifts in investor behavior, with technical and sentiment factors amplifying the correction.[1][2][3]

### Key Causes of the Bitcoin Downturn

- **Panic Selling by Short-Term Holders**
  The bulk of the recent price drop—from above $120,000 to below $95,000—was accelerated by short-term holders selling at a loss, triggering forced liquidations and rapid deleveraging. Long-term holders have taken some profits, but have not initiated widespread distribution typical of bear market cycle tops.[1]

- **Liquidity Crunch**
  Liquidity in Bitcoin markets has thinned notably in recent weeks. Market depth fell from over $700 million in October to roughly $535 million, increasing price vulnerability to large trades and volatility. Thinner order books, mostly due to reduced spot and institutional buying, mean that sell-offs can cascade more easily.[2][3]

- **Macroeconomic Uncertainty**
  The Federal Reserve’s caution on interest rate cuts has rattled risk asset investors, causing many to pull capital from high-risk markets. Any signs of inflation resilience or a strong dollar exacerbate Bitcoin weakness, while trade war fears, especially linked to renewed tensions between the US and China, have further suppressed risk appetite.[4][5][2]

- **Institutional Buying Slowdown**
  Data shows net institutional Bitcoin purchases fell below daily mined supply for the first time in seven months. This indicates large players are not absorbing new supply, raising the risk of deeper corrections, particularly if institutional cash reserves dwindle.[6][3]

- **Technical Breakdowns and Sentiment Shifts**
  The breach of the psychologically significant $100,000 price support triggered a wave of retail panic, with many quick exits below their cost basis. Options and derivatives traders have positioned for further downside, and market sentiment indicators currently show extreme fear.[7][8][2][1]

### Additional Observations

- **Seasonal and Halving Cycles**
  November historically has been a strong month for Bitcoin, often marked by post-halving volatility and a mid-cycle dip before renewed advances. Many analysts believe the current correction may be a healthy reset, clearing leveraged positions and setting up a consolidation phase before a possible rebound, provided macro conditions stabilize.[4][7]

- **On-Chain Data and Market Structure**
  On-chain metrics confirm an increase in coins moving from long-dormant wallets to exchanges, suggesting capitulation by weaker hands rather than mass exodus by foundational investors. ETF flows and net inflows from traditional finance channels have slowed, contributing further to selling pressure.[7][4]

### Conclusion

The sharp Bitcoin  price downturn is not the result of a single factor but rather the intersection of macro headwinds, a crunch in liquidity, waning institutional demand, and technical support breakdowns. As the market absorbs recent losses, renewed inflows and a stabilization in global risk sentiment will be critical for a sustained recovery.[8][3][5][6][2][1][4][7]
